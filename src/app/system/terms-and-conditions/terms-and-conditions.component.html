    <h2>16. User Services</h2>
    <p>Upon the Buyer awarding a Project or Contest to the Seller, and the Seller's acceptance on the Website, or the
        purchase of an item by a Buyer from the Seller, the Buyer and Seller will be deemed to have entered into a User
        Contract under which the Buyer agrees to purchase, and the Seller agrees to deliver the Seller Services. You
        agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the User Agreement.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you
        may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law),
        international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer or Seller, or in any other
        uses you make of the Website.</p>
    <p>If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may
        have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a User Contract.</p>
    <p>Depending on their jurisdiction, Sellers and Buyers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot
        lawfully be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to override a right that by applicable law may
        not be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to violate any laws relating to unfair contracts,
        and this agreement has been specifically redrafted to ensure compliance with unfair contracts legislation. To
        the extent that any component of this User Agreement is in conflict with inalienable rights under local laws,
        all parties intend for this agreement to be read down only insofar as to be in compliance with such local laws
        and no further.</p>
    <p>Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Buyers and Sellers is that of an independent
        contractor. Nothing in this User Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment
        relationship between Users. Nothing in this User Agreement shall in any way be construed as forming a joint
        venture, partnership or an employer-employee relationship between Workifest and any User.</p>

    <h2>17. Special Provisions for Local Jobs</h2>
    <p>Each User acknowledges:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Workifest does not review, approve, recommend or verify any of the credentials, licences or statements of
            capability in relation to Local Jobs (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any non Local Jobs on the Website);
        </li>
        <li>Workifest provides matchmaking and platform services only. Users agree that Workifest has no liability for
            any other aspect of service delivery or interaction between Buyer and Seller. Workifest is not a party to
            any disputes between Buyer and Seller, although we provide a dispute resolution mechanism to assist the
            parties in resolving issues;</li>
        <li>Workifest may from time to time include map features and Workifest may display the location of Users to
            persons browsing the Website on that map. Every Buyer seeking services for Local Jobs will be asked to
            provide the location where the Local Job is to be performed. You expressly agree that Workifest has no
            liability for displaying such information.</li>
        <li>A User must never disclose, in any Project posted, personal details such as the User's name, street number,
            phone number or the email address in any Project description for a Local Job or in any other public
            communication on the Website (these may be disclosed for Local Jobs as required in private direct messages);
        </li>
        <li>Workifest may collect location related data from you via technologies including but not limited to GPS, IP
            address location, wifi, and by other methods. This data may be shared in the context of facilitating
            services for Local Jobs and each User specifically consents to this collection and sharing as part of this
            agreement;</li>
        <li>Upon completion of a Local Job Project, Seller User must log on to the Website and click the "Complete"
            button for that Local Job, as soon as practicable.</li>
        <li>Failure to complete the service or task will constitute a breach of this User Agreement;</li>
        <li>Our fees are applied to the amount of the awarded Seller's bid to perform the services for the Local Job.
            Any items purchased by the Seller as part of performing the service are between the Buyer and Seller.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>18. Funds</h2>
    <p>You may have positive funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be
        provided to you via the Website. If you are a Seller, you may have positive funds if you have successfully
        completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where
        funds may have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.</p>
    <p>Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with financial institutions. Funds in your
        Account are not held separately by us, and may be commingled with our general operating funds, and/or funds of
        other User's Accounts.</p>
    <p>You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.</p>
    <p>We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts from financial institutions with whom we
        hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for
        any imputed interest on such funds.</p>
    <p>If your Account has negative funds, we may:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set-off the negative amount with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;</li>
        <li>If you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any
            reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency (at an
            exchange rate applied by us);</li>
        <li>Reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website;</li>
        <li>Deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or</li>
        <li>Immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another
        debit coming out of your Account.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking services or any
            financial services to you;</li>
        <li>The funds shown in your Account (which may include all Payments, and/or any prepayment of fees and charges
            which you owe to us) represents our unsecured obligations to you with respect to your rights to direct us to
            make payment in relation to the purchase and sale of Seller Services through the Website and provision of
            the Workifest Services;</li>
        <li>If you were a User acquired in an acquisition and your account was migrated to the Website, we are
            responsible for your positive funds only to the extent of the legal documentation between us and any
            acquired marketplace, along with this agreement, and you acknowledge specifically that the onus is on you to
            confirm the validity of your fund, and that any understatement or misstatement in relation to this is not a
            claim against us, and belongs with the counterparty of any prior user agreement to which you agreed;</li>
        <li>To the extent that we are required to release funds from your Account to you, you will become our unsecured
            creditor until such funds are paid to you;</li>
        <li>We are not acting as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to such funds or payments;</li>
        <li>The amount of funds showing in your Account is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit;</li>
        <li>Funds may only be loaded into your Account, or released from your Account, by us and you must only use the
            mechanisms available on the Website to pay for, or receive funds in respect of Seller Services;</li>
        <li>Any refunds required to be processed in your favour will be returned only to the source of the original
            deposit, and cannot be redirected to any other payment source;</li>
        <li>We will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account in an account held by us with a financial
            institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are
            not segregated into a separate account;</li>
        <li>We may commingle your funds with funds of other Users and our own funds and such commingled funds could be
            used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we will remain obliged
            to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this User Agreement.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>19. Limits & Fraud Prevention</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be
        fraudulent. If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a
        fraudulent transaction, this will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you
        must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take
        action against you to recover those funds.</p>
    <p>We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any
        use of the funds) if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of
            your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal
            or chargeback;</li>
        <li>we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;</li>
        <li>we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or</li>
        <li>we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your
        Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift
        the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favour,
        we may remove the funds from your Account. We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances where we
        suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behaviour, while we investigate any such matter.</p>

    <h2>20. Refunds</h2>
    <p>You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except it relates to fees
        or charges payable to us.</p>
    <p>If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to: (1) a disputed payment, the Dispute Resolution Process may
        be followed; or (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.
    </p>
    <p>If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User
        used to make the original payment to us.</p>
    <p>We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so;</li>
        <li>we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs;</li>
        <li>we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time;</li>
        <li>we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent;</li>
        <li>the User made a duplicate payment in error; or</li>
        <li>we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit
            card chargeback.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can request a refund by using our customer support website or emailing us at <a
            href="mailto:support@workifest.com">support&#64;workifest.com</a>. Once you have made a Payment, you
        expressly
        agree to use the dispute resolution process in this agreement, expressly agree to be bound by its ruling and
        expressly agree not to initiate any chargeback request with your card issuer.</p>
    <p>If you initiate any chargeback request or other "Request for Information" or similar process, you expressly agree
        and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions,
        in order to defeat any such chargeback request.</p>
    <p>If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of
        funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.</p>
    <p>If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or
        unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your
        Account.</p>

    <h2>21. Withdrawals</h2>
    <p>Your first withdrawal of funds earned may be delayed for up to fifteen days for security and fraud purposes.</p>
    <p>Subsequent withdrawals may be delayed for up to fifteen days where our fraud prevention policies require a delay.

    <h2>22. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>A chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that a User files with their card issuer or financial institution),
        and any subsequent reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment
        processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow such instructions.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed
        on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Buyers
        through the Website, as well as any processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us on those chargebacks
        and reversals.</p>
    <p>You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal
        instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors). If you initiate any
        chargeback request or other "Request for Information" or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us
        to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat
        any such chargeback request.</p>

    <h2>23. Inactive Accounts</h2>
    <p>User Accounts that have not been logged into for a period of time will incur a maintenance fee per month, until
        either the account is closed or reactivated, for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing
        hosting of the User's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, promotion of your profile on the
        Website and elsewhere, file storage, message transmission, general administrative matters and message and other
        storage costs.</p>

    <h2>24. Right to Refuse Service</h2>
    <p>We may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may
        close, suspend or limit your access to your Account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>if we determine that you have breached, or are acting in breach of this User Agreement;</li>
        <li>if you under-bid on any Project in an attempt to renegotiate the actual price privately, to attempt to avoid
            fees;</li>
        <li>if we determine that you have infringed legal rights (resulting in actual or potential claims), including
            infringing Intellectual Property Rights;</li>
        <li>if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;</li>
        <li>you do not respond to account verification requests;</li>
        <li>you do not complete account verification when requested within 3 months of the date of request;</li>
        <li>you are the subject of a United Nations, Australian, EU, USA or other applicable sanctions regime, or our
            banking and payment relationships otherwise preclude us from conducting business with you;</li>
        <li>to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person; or</li>
        <li>for other reasons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we close your Account due to your breach of this User Agreement, you may also become liable for certain fees
        as described in this User Agreement.</p>
    <p>Without limiting our other remedies, to the extent you have breached this User Agreement, you must pay us all
        fees owed to us and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our employee time) and
        reasonable expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this User
        Agreement will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses
        imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be extremely difficult and
        impracticable to ascertain; (2) if you breach this User Agreement, we may fine you up to INR 5,00,000 for each
        breach and/or we may take legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess of the fine amount; (3)
        a fine of up to INR 5,00,000 is a presently reasonable pre-estimate or minimum estimate of our damages,
        considering all currently existing circumstances, including (without limitation) the relationship of the sum to
        the range of harm to us that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages
        may be impractical or extremely difficult; and (4) we may release the entire (or part of the) amount of the fine
        from your Account to us.</p>
    <p>If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as
        otherwise specified in this User Agreement, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you.</p>
    <p>In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such
        suspension or termination of your Account.</p>

    <h2>25. Disputes With Users</h2>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a dispute arises between you and another User in relation to any
        Project that you will first attempt to resolve any differences that you have in relation to such Project,
        including in relation to the quality of the services provided.</p>

        dispute, Workifest shall have the right to request the Seller and the Buyer to provide documentation in support
        of their claim or position in relation to the dispute. You agree that Workifest has absolute discretion to
        accept or reject any document provided. You also acknowledge that Workifest is not a judicial or alternative
        dispute resolution institution and that we will make the determinations only as an ordinary reasonable person.

        or correct and you agree to indemnify and (to the maximum extent permitted by law) hold Workifest and any of our
        affiliates harmless against any damages or liability you may suffer as a result of any documentation or material
        subsequently being found to be false or misleading.</p>

        reasonable and fair demands/offers on your dispute. No conduct relating to threats, blackmail, intimidation or
        inducement of users to leave positive feedback will be tolerated, in particular any refusal to provide either
        deliverables or payment in relation to the provision of feedback.</p>
    <p>A User found to be in breach of the Code of Conduct during the Dispute Resolution Service process may
        automatically lose the dispute in favour of the other party involved, regardless of the origin of the dispute.
        The User who breached the Code of Conduct may also incur further disciplinary action. For more information, read
        the Code of Conduct.</p>

    <h2>26. Disputes With Us</h2>
    <p>If a dispute arises between you and Workifest, our goal is to address your concerns immediately and, if we are
        unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly
        encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our customer support website or
        emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@workifest.com">support&#64;workifest.com</a>.</p>
    <p>For any claim, Workifest may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding
        non-appearance-based arbitration. If Workifest elects arbitration, such arbitration will be initiated through an
        established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR
        providers that Workifest will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following
        rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the
            specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</li>
        <li>the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
            mutually agreed by the parties; and</li>
        <li>any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All claims you bring against Workifest must be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All
        claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of this
        Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to the terms of this Agreement, Workifest may recover its legal fees
        and costs (including in-house lawyers and paralegals), provided that Workifest has notified you in writing of
        the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
    <p>You agree that you will not pursue any claims arising under this User Agreement on a class or other
        representative basis and will not seek to coordinate or consolidate any arbitration or action hereunder with any
        other proceeding.</p>
    <p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law,
        Workifest will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
        expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Workifest's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect
        to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>

    <h2>27. Currencies</h2>
    <p>Some of the Websites will display rates in the local currency of that Website, in addition to the actual amount.
        These rates are based on a conversion from the originating currency using indicative market exchange rates. You
        understand and agree that these rates are only indicative and the amount specified in the origin currency is the
        actual amount.</p>
    <p>As a convenience service, you may withdraw funds from the Website in another currency. If you wish to do so, you
        will be quoted an exchange rate which will be available for the time specified, which you may choose to accept.
        We may charge a fee for effecting the currency conversion transactions. This fee will be embedded within the
        rate provided to you and the currency exchange will be settled immediately.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to reject any request for a conversion of currency at any time.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for all risks associated with converting and maintaining funds in various available
        currencies, including but not limited to the risk that the value of these funds will fluctuate as exchange rates
        change, which could result in decreases in the value of your funds in aggregate. You must not use (or attempt to
        use) the Website to engage in speculative trading, which could result in substantial losses. We are not a
        financial services provider.</p>

        in connection with a Contest including but not limited to loss suffered (or penalties imposed) in connection
        with any contravention of law.</p>
    <p>Entrants may submit their entries in image, video, text or other format as specified on the Website. All entries
        must comply with the Contest Brief and must not infringe any Intellectual Property Rights. Any entry which
        infringes any Intellectual Property Rights will be an ineligible entry and subject to removal either by the

    <p>This agreement supersedes any other agreement between you and the Company. If any part of this document is found
        to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this document will
        otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of this document is not a waiver of
        any of our rights to later enforce that or any other part of this document. We may assign any of our rights and
        obligations under this document from time to time.</p>
    <p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that the

        damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising
        out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall
        and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims
        which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
        which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>
